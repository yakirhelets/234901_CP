7425 - Cleaning Pipes

Solution Description:
The problem resembles a two-coloring graph problem:
Every two pipes that intersect cannot contain robots (two colors).
First, we find all the intersections between the pipes. That can be done by finding their orientation.
Next, we build the graph: every vertex is a pipe, and we connect between the intersected pipes.
Lastly, we solve the 2-coloring problem using DFS.

Time Complexity:
Finding intersections: O(N*log(N)
+ DFS, building the graph: O(V+E)
