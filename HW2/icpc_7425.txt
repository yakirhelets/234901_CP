description:
The problem resembles a two-coloring graph problem:
every two pipes that intersect cannot contain robots (two colors).
First, we find all the intersections between the pipes. That can be done
by finding their orientation.
Next, we build the graph: every vertex is a pipe, and we connect
between the intersected pipes.
Lastly, we solve the 2-coloring problem using DFS.
nontrivial data structures: -
time complexity: finding intersections: O(N*log(N)
+ DFS, building the graph: O(V+E)
