105 - The Skyline Problem

Solution Description:
Go over all the buildings using the sweep line paradigm:
Events: x-coordinate of both starting point and ending point of buildings.
Order: From left to right.
Status: heights of "active" buildings, ordered.
Any time the status maximum heights changes, then at the current x-coordinate the skyline changes.
Things to take note of:
Do all the processing for events with the same x-coordinate before checking if the maximum height has changed.
Print the starting 0 height at x=1 if all the buildings are starting only after it.

Time Complexity:
Given n buildings:
Reading the input is O(n) and building the list of events O(n*log(n)) because of sorting.
For each event we do at most 2 operations of the status structure, which is a BST, that will have at most n items. Therefore each event takes O(log(n)) time in the worse case.
There are O(n) events so overall the whole sweep takes O(n*log(n)) time.
Overall the time complexity is O(n*log(n)).
