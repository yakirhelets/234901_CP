7274 - Canvas Painting

Solution Description:
The machine's operation resembles a binary search.
We split an "array" (row of canvases of the same color) into two parts, each part is turned into its own array (receives a single color) and then we repeat the same operation on the two sub arrays.
The total amount of ink needed is the sum of all elements in each of the arrays (sizes of each piece in a row of canvases) in every step of merging N elements (N canvases of different color) into a row of N canvases of the same color, in the same fashion it was split by the machine.
The best way to do a binary search is to split each array to half.
The minimal cost would be a sum of elements of each array in every step of merge sorting an already sorted array.
We'll use a min heap to maintain the order.

Time Complexity:
O(N*log(N)), where N is the number of canvases.
