11362 - Phone List

Solution Description:
We want to check that there is no phone number which is a substring of another number in the phone book.
We'll use a trie.
Whenever inserting a new string (phone number) to the trie, we'll check if it is traversing an already made path, which was created by a previous phone number.
Either it contains another number, or it is a part of another number.

Time Complexity:
Each phone number is of max length of 10.
Inserting will take ±10 operations, and we could get maximum 10k numbers.
So it's a total of ±100k operations per test case.
