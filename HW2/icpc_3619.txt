3619 - Sum of Different Primes 

Solution Description:
We'll use dynamic programming.
The definition would be f(n, k) - the number of sets of k distinct prime numbers which sums up to n.
The base would be f(0, 0) = 1 - only the the empty set sums up to 0 which satisfies our constraints.
we'll build the table for each prime, since a prime number might occur only once in a set.
The recursion rule: for each prime p: f(n, k) += f (n - p, k - 1)

Time Complexity:
Making the set of primes using the Sieve of Eratosthenes costs O(N*log(log(N))) where N = 1120.
constructing the DP table will cost at the worst cast = P * N * K = (1120 * 1120 * 15).
This is being done only once and each test case is checking the table's appropriate value.
