1111 - Trash Removal

Solution Description:
Given a polygon, computing the smallest chute width that will allow it to pass through can be done simply by using rotating calipers.
This is straightforward: read input, run convex hull, run rotating calipers, repeat.

Time Complexity:
For each test case (Given n points):
Reading the input is O(n).
Running convex hull is O(n*log(n)), resulting in h <= n points.
Running rotating calipers takes O(h) time.
Overall the time complexity is O(n*log(n)) per test case.
