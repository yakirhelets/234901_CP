1. Sort the payers by the amount they're willing to pay and by their index
2. For each amount reduce by div=min(price/payers,minimal amount that can be payed)
3. If there's any remainder left from the division (must be lower than the remaining number of payers),
    spread the remainder by the remaining payer by the order above.
4. Update the price to be the amount of money that is left to pay.
5. Repeat the process until price = 0.

time complexity: O(nlogn+n)
