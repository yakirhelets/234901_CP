1. Add tuples of the queries and interval time into a minimum heap (sorted by the interval,
 and then by the query number itself)
2. For K times:
    a. print the top query and pop it. We know it's the earlier of all the queries.
    b. insert a new tuple to the heap with the same query number and the new interval time.
nontrivial data structures: -
time complexity: O(n*logn)
