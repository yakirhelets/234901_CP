1. Iterate over all the possible permutations of 1,2,...,8 w.r.t to the given queen position.
    Each permutation represents the row of the i'th column queen.
2. Since every queen has it's own unique column and row, we must check only the diagonals for a valid solution.
nontrivial data structures: -
time complexity: O(7!*(1+2+...+8))=O(1)
