Trivial solution is too slow here. A solution for this problem can be achieved with
Dynamic Programming:
Base Cases: S=0 - Return the numbers as is
            S=1 - Follow the formula
Sub Problem: Notice that we can address the N numbers as constants. We only need
to calculate their coefficients, determined by S. In order to calculate the coefficients of S,
we need the coefficients of S/2. That can be achieved by multiply the coefficients'
vector by itself (similar to vector multiplication). Lastly, we'll multiply the coefficients
with their corresponding numbers.
nontrivial data structures: -
time complexity: O(n^2)
