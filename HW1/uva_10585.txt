Notice the following:
A. Consider two points p,q. So according to the center of symmetry's definition, center=(p+q)/2
B. The center of symmetry is similar to all pairs of points
Therefore, in order to find the center of symmetry, we need to find the average between
two "reflective" points. We can do that easily by sorting the points (by x and then by y).
for 0<i<n-1, the i'th point and the n-1-i'th points are "reflective".
The "minimal" and the "maximal" points can produce the center of symmetry between them.
Then, we need to compare the rest of the pairs with the center of symmetry that we found.
