Notice that we only need to compare between to words the first two different letter
in a certain position in order to determine the letter's order.
1. Build a graph that represents the above order
2. Run DFS algorithm on the graph for every non-visited letter as the source. The output
    is the order between the letters reversed
nontrivial data structures: -
time complexity: O(V+E)
